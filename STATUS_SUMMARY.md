# üìã Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed Today

1. **Blank Screen Crash** - FIXED
   - Added ErrorBoundary component
   - Removed ReactMarkdown dependency
   - Added safe navigation operators

2. **Undefined Property Errors** - FIXED
   - Added null checks throughout geminiService
   - Protected all .toFixed() calls
   - Ensured arrays are always defined

3. **Output Display Parsing** - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Updated parser to handle new four-call format
   - Properly extracts Technical Annex sections
   - Added debug logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

### 1. **Truncated Plays Output** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Strategic Capture Plays cut off at "Demo:" field
**Root Cause**: Model likely hitting token limits or safety filters
**Quick Fix**:
```typescript
// In composePlaysPrompt(), simplify the template:
Format each play (keep it concise):
**Play Name**: [name]
- Offer: [what we provide]
- Proof: [evidence/capability]
- Vehicles: [contract vehicles]
- Win Theme: [why we win]
```

### 2. **Tab Content Alignment**
**Problem**: Some JSON appearing in wrong tabs
**Status**: Parser updated but needs testing

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Fix Truncated Plays (5 min)
```bash
# Edit services/geminiService.ts
# Simplify the plays template
# Reduce from 7 fields to 4-5 fields
```

### Step 2: Test Complete Flow
```bash
# 1. Clear browser cache
# 2. Upload test files
# 3. Generate briefing
# 4. Verify all sections populate
```

### Step 3: Implement Progressive Rendering
```typescript
// Show results as they arrive:
onProgress('BRIEFING_MD', 'ok', briefing);
// Update UI immediately with partial results
```

## üìä Current Performance

- **Distillation**: Working (1719 ‚Üí 24 cards)
- **API Calls**: All 4 executing successfully
- **Error Handling**: Robust with fallbacks
- **UI Responsiveness**: Good, no crashes

## üéØ Priority Improvements

1. **Fix Plays Truncation** (Immediate)
2. **Add Section Regeneration** (Next Sprint)
3. **Implement Confidence Scores** (Future)
4. **Add Export Functionality** (Future)

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Distillation is Working Well**
   - 98.6% reduction while maintaining signal
   - Could experiment with keeping 50 cards instead of 24

2. **Four-Call Architecture is Solid**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Easy to debug individual sections
   - Could parallelize for speed

3. **Model Behavior**
   - Gemini-2.0-flash handles JSON well
   - Struggles with complex structured markdown
   - May need different prompting strategy

## üîß Configuration to Consider

```typescript
const CONFIG = {
  distillation: {
    targetCards: 50,  // Increase from 24
    minScore: 0.7     // Add quality threshold
  },
  api: {
    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',
    timeout: 120000,
    maxRetries: 2
  },
  output: {
    maxPlayFields: 5,  // Reduce from 7
    progressiveRender: true
  }
};
```

## ‚ú® What's Working Great

1. **Resilient Architecture** - No more crashes!
2. **Intelligent Distillation** - Handles large files
3. **Clear Error Messages** - User knows what's happening
4. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Always produces output

## üö® Critical Path Forward

1. **Today**: Fix plays truncation
2. **Tomorrow**: Add section validation
3. **This Week**: Implement quality scoring
4. **Next Week**: Add export and refinement features

---

**The app is now stable and functional.** The main issue is output completeness, which can be resolved through prompt engineering and response validation.
